# About me 👩‍💻

💻 **Multiplatform Application Development student (DAM)**

🎓 **B1 and B2 Cambridge English Titles**

📍 **Studying in: IES Telesforo Bravo (2025-2026)**

I'm Atteneri, a DAM student motivated by learning and continuously improving my programming skills. I like to transform ideas into functional applications, working on both logic and design.

In my free time I love to play videogames, read, draw, and watch series and movies, activities that help me develop my creative side and disconnect. I also enjoy travelling and discovering new places, as it provides me with new experiences. Besides, I usually listen to music while I program or study to concentrate and stay motivated.
